# Waste-Management
Trained a CNN model that classifies the waste as per the dustbin it should be thrown in. 
The image of recyclable waste is identified as blue, 
that of organic waste is identified as green, 
and the rest inorganic waste goes into the yellow dustbin.

This system can be used in Colleges, Offices, and Societies.
